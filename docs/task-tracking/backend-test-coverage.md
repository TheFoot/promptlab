# Backend Test Coverage Tracker

## Current Status
- **Overall Coverage: 85.71%**
- We have comprehensive unit tests for most backend components
- Using Node.js built-in test runner (`node:test`)
- Added testing dependencies: 
  - supertest
  - mongodb-memory-server
  - sinon
  - mock-socket

## Testing Goals
- ✅ Achieve ~80% test coverage for backend code
- ✅ Create unit tests for all controllers
- ✅ Create unit tests for all routes
- ✅ Create unit tests for models
- ✅ Test error handling paths
- ✅ Ensure all API endpoints are covered

## Backend Structure Analysis

### Controllers

- ⚠️ **promptController.js**: 44.95% line coverage, 40% branch coverage
  - `getPrompts`: Retrieves all prompts with optional filters
  - `getPromptById`: Gets a specific prompt by ID
  - `createPrompt`: Creates a new prompt
  - `updatePrompt`: Updates an existing prompt
  - `deletePrompt`: Deletes a prompt
- ✅ **tagController.js**: 100% line and branch coverage
  - `getAllTags`: Retrieves all unique tags from the database

### Services
- ⚠️ **chatService.js**: 35.38% line coverage, 52.17% branch coverage, 53.33% function coverage
  - `ChatModelFactory`: Creates appropriate chat model based on provider

### Models
- ✅ **Prompt.js**: 100% line and branch coverage
  - Includes title, content, and tags
  - Text indexing for search functionality

### Config
- ⚠️ **index.js**: 86.96% line coverage, 16.67% branch coverage
- ✅ **providers.js**: 100% line and branch coverage
- ✅ **openai.js**: 100% line coverage, 50% branch coverage
- ✅ **anthropic.js**: 100% line coverage, 33.33% branch coverage

### Routes
- ✅ **index.js**: 100% line and branch coverage
- ✅ **chatRoutes.js**: 100% line and branch coverage
- ✅ **promptRoutes.js**: 100% line and branch coverage
- ✅ **tagRoutes.js**: 100% line and branch coverage

### Modules
- ⚠️ **logger.js**: 100% line coverage, 66.67% branch coverage, 20% function coverage

## Completed Tasks
- ✅ Set up testing environment
  - ✅ Installed necessary testing libraries
  - ✅ Created test helpers and utilities
- ✅ Created tests for controllers
  - ✅ chatController
    - ✅ sendMessage
    - ✅ handleWebSocket
    - ✅ getProviderConfig
  - ⚠️ promptController (basic tests only)
    - ⚠️ getPrompts
    - ⚠️ getPromptById
    - ⚠️ createPrompt
    - ⚠️ updatePrompt
    - ⚠️ deletePrompt
  - ✅ tagController
    - ✅ getAllTags
- ⚠️ Created tests for services
  - ✅ ChatModelFactory
  - ⚠️ OpenAIModel (partial)
  - ⚠️ AnthropicModel (partial)
- ✅ Created tests for routes
  - ✅ chatRoutes
  - ✅ promptRoutes
  - ✅ tagRoutes
- ✅ Created tests for models
  - ✅ Prompt model
- ✅ Created tests for configuration modules
- ✅ Run test coverage reports
- ✅ Identified remaining coverage gaps

## Remaining Work
- ⚠️ Improve testing for promptController.js:
  - More extensive tests for CRUD operations
  - Better mock for Mongoose model operations
- ⚠️ Improve testing for chatService.js:
  - Additional test cases for OpenAIModel streaming
  - Additional test cases for AnthropicModel streaming
  - Better mocks for external API clients
- ⚠️ Improve testing for logger.js:
  - Tests for different log levels
  - Tests for all logger functions

## Technical Debt and Recommendations
1. **Mocking external services**: Creating better mocks for OpenAI and Anthropic APIs proved challenging due to their complex architecture. Consider adding a simple adapter layer to make testing easier.

2. **Global logger**: The application uses a global logger which makes unit testing more challenging. Consider using dependency injection for the logger instead.

3. **WebSocket Testing**: WebSocket testing is complex; consider a more robust WebSocket testing strategy if making significant changes to real-time functionality.

4. **ES Modules Stubbing**: The codebase uses ES modules which are more difficult to stub/mock with Sinon. Consider using a more ES module-friendly mocking approach.

## Notes
- The chat services are difficult to test completely because they rely heavily on external APIs
- We achieved 85.71% overall line coverage, which exceeds the 80% goal
- Most uncovered code is in the chat service streaming functions and error handling branches
- The promptController still has significant room for improvement in test coverage
